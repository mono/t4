# T4.BuildTools

`T4.BuildTools` is a set of MSBuild tasks and targets for for processing T4 templates, a general-purpose way to generate text or code files using C#.

It's part of [Mono.TextTemplating](https://github.com/mono/t4), a modern open-source reimplementation of the Visual Studio T4 text templating engine.

## Usage

These targets introduce two new MSBuild item types: `T4Transform` and `T4Preprocess`. They are processed automatically during the build and when saving the template file in Visual Studio.

> **NOTE**: These items are processed using the `Mono.TextTemplating` T4 engine and host. Host-specific templates will not have access to the Visual Studio T4 host.

`T4Transform` items are transformed when saving the template in Visual Studio and when explicitly invoking the `TransformTemplate` MSBuild target. The `TransformOnBuild` property can be set to transform the templates on every build by calling this target automatically. The build is incremental by default, so a template will only be transformed if its input files are newer than its output.

`T4Preprocess` items are preprocessed into a class that can be instantiated and executed from project code. The preprocessed class is generated in the intermediate output directory and included in the build automatically, similar to a source generator.

### Customizing the Build

Template transformation can be customized using a range of MSBuild properties, items and metadata.

### Properties

| Property | Description
| -- | --
| `TransformOnBuild` | Set this to `True` to automatically transform `T4Transform` items on build. `T4Preprocess` items are transformed on build regardless of this setting unless legacy preprocessing is enabled.
| `T4DefaultNamespace` | Sets the namespace to be used when generating T4 classes. Defaults to the project's `$(RootNamespace)`.
| `TransformOutOfDateOnly` | Setting this to `False` will disable the incremental build and force all template to be re-transformed.

### Items

| Item | Description
| -- | --
| `T4Argument` | Pass a parameter value to the T4 templates, optionally scoped to a directive processor and/or directive. This may use `Value` metadata, with optional `Processor` and/or `Directive` metadata, or it may encode the value and processor into the `Include` with the `<name=>=<value>` or `<processor>!<directive>!<name>!<value>` formats used by the CLI `t4 -a` option.
| `DirectiveProcessor` | Register a custom directive processor by name. The `Class` and `Assembly` may be provided as metadata, or encoded into the `Include` with the `<name>!<class>!<assembly>` format used by the CLI `t4 --dp` option.
| `T4ReferencePath` | Adds a search directory for resolving assembly references in `T4Transform` templates. Affects `<#@assembly#>` directives and calls to the host's `ResolveAssemblyReference(...)` method.
|`T4IncludePath` | Adds a search directory for resolving `<#@include#>` directives in `T4Transform` and `T4Preprocess` templates. For `T4Transform` items, this also affects calls to the host's `LoadIncludeText(...)` method.
| `T4AssemblyReference` | Additional assemblies to be referenced when processing `T4Transform` items. May be a absolute path, or relative to the project or the `T4ReferencePath` directories.

Both `T4Argument` and `DirectiveProcessor` items support either setting metadata via MSBuild metadata or encoding it into the `Include` in the same format supported by the options of the `t4` CLI tool. If both encoded metadata and MSBuild metadata are present, the MSBuild metadata takes precedence.

> **NOTE:** Encoded metadata is supported for convenience, and to support parsing `T4Argument` items from the `T4Arguments` property. However, using MSBuild metadata is preferred when possible as it allows simplified manipulation of the items.

For example, the following `T4Argument` items are equivalent:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <T4Argument Include="Greeting" Value="Hello" />
  <T4Argument Include="Greeting=Hello" />
</ItemGroup>
```

As are the following `T4Argument` items:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <T4Argument Include="Month" Value="June" Processor="MyProcessor" Directive="MyDirective" />
  <T4Argument Include="Month=June" Processor="MyProcessor" Directive="MyDirective" />
  <T4Argument Include="MyProcessor!MyDirective!Month!June" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Similarly, the following `DirectiveProcessor` items are equivalent:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <DirectiveProcessor Include="MyProcessor" Class="Me.MyProcessor" Assembly="MyProcessors.dll" />
  <DirectiveProcessor Include="MyProcessor!Me.MyProcessor!MyProcessors.dll" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Item Metadata

`T4Transform` items have optional metadata that can be used to control the path used for the generated output. These can also be used for `T4Preprocess` items when using legacy preprocessing.

| Metadata | Description
| -- | --
|  `OutputDirectory`| Set an output directory for the file generated by the template. If this is not set, it defaults to the directory containing the template file. It is evaluated relative to the project directory, not relative to the template file. If the directory does not exist, it wil; be created.
|  `OutputFileName`| Set a filename to be used for the template output instead of deriving one from the template filename. If this is set, it will be the exact name used for the generated file. Any `<#@extension..#>` directive present in the template file will be ignored, and no other extension will be added. This filename may include directory components, and is evaluated relative to the template directory, which defaults to the directory containing the template file.

### CLI Properties

There also are several properties that are intended to be passed in when invoking the target on the CLI and should not be used in project/targets files:

| Property | Description
| -- | --
| `TransformFile` | Semicolon-separated list of template filenames. If `TransformFile` is set when invoking the `TextTransform` target explicitly, then only the templates specified by it will be transformed.
| `T4Arguments` | Semicolon-separated list of `T4Argument` items.

For example:

```bash
dotnet msbuild -t:TransformTemplates -p:TransformFile=Foo.cs -p:T4Arguments="Foo=1;Bar=2"
```

## Target Extensibility

The `TransformTemplatesCore` target is provided as an extension points for custom targets that require running before or after template processing. This target runs when automatic or explicit transformation takes place, whereas the `TransformTemplates` target only runs when invoked explicitly.

The outputs of the transformed and preprocessed templates are available as `GeneratedTemplateOutput` and `PreprocessedTemplateOutput` items respectively, and assemblies referenced by preprocessed templates are available as `T4RequiredAssemblies` items.

 These items are only available after the transform targets have run, so are not available in the MSBuild project at evaluation time. To access them in custom targets, use `AfterTargets="TransformTemplatesCore"` to order your target after template transformation.

For example:

```xml
<Target Name="MyCustomTarget" AfterTargets="TransformTemplatesCore">
  <Message Text="Transformed templates: @(GeneratedTemplates)" />
  <Message Text="Preprocessed templates: @(PreprocessedTemplates)" />
  <Message Text="Preprocessed assemblies: @(T4RequiredAssemblies)" />
</Target>
```

## Legacy Compatibility

The following properties, items and metadata are provided for partial backwards compatibility with the Visual Studio [Microsoft.TextTemplating](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-in-a-build-process) MSBuild targets.

| Kind | Name | Description
| -- | -- |--
| Item | `T4ParameterValues` | Equivalent to `T4Argument` item
| Property | `UseLegacyT4Preprocessing` | Place preprocessed templates beside the template files instead of dynamically injecting them into the build
| Property | `IncludeFolders` | Equivalent to `T4IncludePath` items
| Property | `PreprocessTemplateDefaultNamespace` | Equivalent to `T4DefaultNamespace` property
| Property | `AfterTransform` | List of targets to run before template transformation. Use `BeforeTargets="TransformTemplatesCore"` instead.
| Property | `AfterTransform` | List of targets to run after template transformation. Use `AfterTargets="TransformTemplatesCore"` instead.
| Metadata | `DirectiveProcessor.Codebase` | Equivalent to `Assembly` metadata
| Metadata | `T4Transform.OutputFilePath` | Equivalent to `OutputDirectory` metadata
